# Portfolio Project - How to Run

Open the Portfolio-Website folder

Welcome to my portfolio project! Follow the steps below to set up and view the project on your local machine using Vite.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- Install a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Clone or download the portfolio project files from the repository.

## Steps to Run the Portfolio

### 1. Navigate to the Project Folder
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the project files. Use the following command:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project-folder
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. Run:
```bash
npm install
```
This will download and set up all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Start the Development Server
Use Vite to launch the development server. Run the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open in Browser
Once the development server starts, you will see an output similar to:
```
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in XX ms

  Local: http://localhost:XXXX/
  Network: http://192.168.X.XXX:XXXX/
```
Open your browser and navigate to the `Local` link, typically `http://localhost:3000/`.

### 5. Explore the Portfolio
You can now interact with and view the portfolio on your local machine. Changes made to the project files will automatically refresh in the browser.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter issues, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly and your Node.js version is up to date.
- For deployment, refer to Viteâ€™s [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

Enjoy exploring the portfolio!
